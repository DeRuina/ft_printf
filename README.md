# ft_printf

My own implementation of the famous printf. 
The project was a 42 curriculum project, it only has the following
format specifiers:
```bash
  %c - prints a character
  %s - prints a string
  %p - prints the address of the variable
  %d - prints a decimal number
  %i - prints a decimal number 
  %u - prints a positive number (unsigned)
  %x - prints a hexadeimal number in lowercase
  %X - prints a hexadeimal number in uppercase
  %% - prints a %
```
In order to comline the program you just run in the terminal
the command: 
```bash
make
```
